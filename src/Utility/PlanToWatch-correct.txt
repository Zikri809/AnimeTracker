Nonetheless, he goes to great lengths to keep his unique hobby a secret, as he believes that he would be ridiculed were it revealed. \n\nEnter Marin Kitagawa, an extraordinarily pretty girl whose confidence and poise are in stark contrast to Gojou's meekness. It would defy common sense for the friendless Gojou to mix with the likes of Kitagawa, who is always surrounded by her peers. However, the unimaginable happens when Kitagawa discovers Gojou's prowess with a sewing machine and brightly confesses to him about her own hobby: cosplay. Because her sewing skills are pitiable, she decides to enlist his help.\n\nAs Gojou and Kitagawa work together on one cosplay outfit after another, they cannot help but grow close—even though their lives are worlds apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"winter","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":53065,"type":"anime","name":"Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53065/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru_Season_2"}]},{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":112268,"type":"manga","name":"Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/112268/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"San San Days (燦々デイズ)\" by Spira Spica"],"endings":["\"Koi no Yukue (恋ノ行方)\" by Akari Akase (あかせあかり)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https://bisquedoll-anime.com/"},{"name":"@kisekoi_anime","url":"https://twitter.com/kisekoi_anime"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=16250"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24306"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dress-Up_Darling#Anime"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE%E7%9D%80%E3%81%9B%E6%9B%BF%E3%81%88%E4%BA%BA%E5%BD%A2%E3%81%AF%E6%81%8B%E3%82%92%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B#%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/6200"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282178"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/th/play/1035102"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"},{"name":"iQIYI","url":"https://www.iq.com/"}],"userstatus":"Plan To Watch","userprogress":0,"userscore":0}]]
